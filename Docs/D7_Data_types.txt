:: Range Function : 

- A Python range is an immutable sequence of numbers which is typically used to iterate through a specific number of items.

- It is represented by the Range class. The constructor of this class accepts a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and increments to 1 until it reaches a specified number. Following is the syntax of the function.

range(start, stop, step)


#start: Integer number to specify starting position, (Its optional, Default: 0)

#stop: Integer number to specify ending position (It's mandatory)

#step: Integer number to specify increment, (Its optional, Default: 1)
