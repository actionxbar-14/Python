# :: input function reads the input given by the user as a string and returns it.

# a = input()
# print(type(a)) --> <class 'str'>

# a = input()
# b = int(a)
# print(type(b)) --> <class 'int'>


# name = input("Enter your name :")
# print(f"your name is : {name}")
# age = input("enter your age :")
# print(f"{name} is {int(age)} years old. and next year you will be {int(age)+1} years old")
# print(type(age))


# a = input("enter value of a:")
# b = input("enter value of b:")

# print(f"sum of {a}+{b} is:{int(a)+int(b)}")


#HW : write a program to input student name and marks of 3 subjects and print name and percentage.

# name = input("Enter you name :")
# sub1_maths = input("enter your marks is maths:")
# sub2_science = input("enter your marks is science:")
# sub3_english = input("enter your marks is english:")

# total = (int(sub1_maths)+int(sub2_science)+int(sub3_english)/300*100)
# print(f"name is secured {sub1_maths} is maths and {sub2_science} in science and {sub3_english} in english and total percentage is {total}%")


# name = int(input("Enter you name :"))
# sub1_maths = int(input("enter your marks is maths:"))
# sub2_science = int(input("enter your marks is science:"))
# sub3_english = int(input("enter your marks is english:"))

# total = ((sub1_maths)+(sub2_science)+(sub3_english)/300*100)
# print(f"name is secured {sub1_maths} is maths and {sub2_science} in science and {sub3_english} in english and total percentage is {total}%")
