:: Variables : 

- Python variables are the reserved memory locations used to store values with in a Python Program. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory.

- Based on the data type of a variable, memory space is allocated to it. Therefore, by assigning different data types to Python variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.


: Memory Addresses :-

- Data items belonging to different data types are stored in computer's memory. Computer's memory locations are having a number or address, internally represented in binary form. Data is also stored in binary form as the computer works on the principle of binary representation. In the following diagram, a string May and a number 18 is shown as stored in memory locations.

- If you know the assembly language, you will covert these data items and the memory address, and give a machine language instruction. However, it is not easy for everybody. Language translator such as Python interpreter performs this type of conversion. It stores the object in a randomly chosen memory location. Python's built-in id() function returns the address where the object is stored.

>>> "May"
May
>>> id("May")
2167264641264

>>> 18
18
>>> id(18)
140714055169352



- Once the data is stored in the memory, it should be accessed repeatedly for performing a certain process. Obviously, fetching the data from its ID is cumbersome. High level languages like Python make it possible to give a suitable alias or a label to refer to the memory location.

- In the above example, let us label the location of May as month, and location in which 18 is stored as age. Python uses the assignment operator (=) to bind an object with the label.

>>> month="May"
>>> age=18


- The data object (May) and its name (month) have the same id(). The id() of 18 and age are also same.

>>> id(month)
2167264641264


>>> id(age)
140714055169352






:: Deleting Python Variables :-
You can delete the reference to a number object by using the del statement. The syntax of the del statement is −

del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]
You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the del statement. For example 

del var
del var_a, var_b





:: Getting Type of a Variable :-
You can get the data type of a Python variable using the python built-in function type() as follows.

x = "Zara"
y =  10
z =  10.10

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))



:: Python Variables - Multiple Assignment :-

- Python allows to initialize more than one variables in a single statement. In the following case, three variables have same value.

>>> a=10
>>> b=10
>>> c=10


- Instead of separate assignments, you can do it in a single assignment statement as follows :  

>>> a=b=c=10
>>> print (a,b,c)
10 10 10



- These separate assignment statements can be combined in one. You need to give comma separated variable names on left, and comma separated values on the right of = operator.

>>> a,b,c = 10,20,30
>>> print (a,b,c)
10 20 30




:: Python Variables - Naming Convention :-

1.A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.

2.A variable name cannot start with a number or any special character like $, (, * % etc.

3.A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).

4.Python variable names are case-sensitive which means Name and NAME are two different variables in Python.

5.Python reserved keywords cannot be used naming the variable.
