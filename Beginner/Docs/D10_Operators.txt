:-Unary operators: Python operators that require one operand to perform a specific operation are known as unary operators.

:-Binary operators: Python operators that require two operands to perform a specific operation are known as binary operators.

:-Operands: Variables, values, or expressions that are used with the operator to perform a specific operation.




:: Types of Python Operators :

- Python operators are categorized in the following categories :

1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Comparison (Relational) Operators
3.Assignment Operators
4.Logical Operators
5.Bitwise Operators
6.Membership Operators
7.Identity Operators
