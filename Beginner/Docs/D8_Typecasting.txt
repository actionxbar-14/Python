:: TypeCasting :

- Python Type Casting is a process in which we convert a literal of one data type to another data type. Python supports two types of casting − implicit and explicit.


1. implicit TypeCasting.
2. Explicit TypeCasting.



1. implicit TypeCasting : 


- When any language compiler/interpreter automatically converts object of one type into other, it is called automatic or implicit casting. Python is a strongly typed language. It doesn't allow automatic type conversion between unrelated data types. For example, a string cannot be converted to any number type. However, an integer can be cast into a float. Other languages such as JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where an integer is coerced into a string for concatenation.

- Note that memory requirement of each data type is different. For example, an integer object in Python occupies 4 bytes of memory, while a float object needs 8 bytes because of its fractional part. Hence, Python interpreter doesn't automatically convert a float to int, because it will result in loss of data. On the other hand, int can be easily converted into float by setting its fractional part to 0.

- Implicit int to float casting takes place when any arithmetic operation on int and float operands is done.



Ex: Consider we have an ,int and one float variable

<<< a=10   # int object
<<< b=10.5 # float object

- To perform their addition, 10 − the integer object is upgraded to 10.0. It is a float, but equivalent to its earlier numeric value. Now we can perform addition of two floats.


<<< c=a+b
<<< print (c)
20.5




# NOTE :

- In implicit type casting, a Python object with lesser byte size is upgraded to match the bigger byte size of other object in the operation. For example, a Boolean object is first upgraded to int and then to float, before the addition with a floating point object. In the following example, we try to add a Boolean object in a float, pleae note that True is equal to 1, and False is equal to 0.

a=True;
b=10.5;
c=a+b;

print (c);    output : 11.5

2.  Explicit Casting : 

-   Although automatic or implicit casting is limited to int to float conversion, you can use Python's built-in functions int(), float() and str() to perform the explicit conversions such as string to integer.



: Python int() Function : 

Python's built-in int() function converts an integer literal to an integer object, a float to integer, and a string to integer if the string itself has a valid integer literal representation.

Using int() with an int object as argument is equivalent to declaring an int object directly.

<<< a = int(10)
<<< a
10



--->  String to Integer : 

The int() function returns an integer from a string object, only if it contains a valid integer representation.


Ex :


 <<< a = int("100")
<<< a
100
<<< type(a)
<class 'int'>
<<< a = ("10"+"01")
<<< a = int("10"+"01")
<<< a
1001
<<< type(a)
<class 'int'>








# NOTE  1 : 

- However, if the string contains a non-integer representation, Python raises ValueError.

Ex : 

<<< a = int("10.5")
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10.5'
<<< a = int("Hello World")
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Hello World'











# NOTE 2 : 
 - The int() function also returns integer from binary, octal and hexa-decimal string. For this, the function needs a base parameter which must be 2, 8 or 16 respectively. The string should have a valid binary/octal/Hexa-decimal representation.


--> Binary String to Integer : 

- The string should be made up of 1 and 0 only, and the base should be 2.

<<< a = int("110011", 2)
<<< a
51
The Decimal equivalent of binary number 110011 is 51.


--> Octal String to Integer : 

- The string should only contain 0 to 7 digits, and the base should be 8.


<<< a = int("20", 8)
<<< a
16
The Decimal equivalent of octal 20 is 16.


--> Hexa-Decimal String to Integer : 

<<< a = int("2A9", 16)
<<< a
681

Decimal equivalent of Hexadecimal 2A9 is 681. You can easily verify these conversions with calculator app in Windows, Ubuntu or Smartphones.






: Python float() Function : 

- The float() is a built-in function in Python. It returns a float object if the argument is a float literal, integer or a string with valid floating point representation. 


- Using float() with an float object as argument is equivalent to declaring a float object directly.

<<< a = float(9.99)
<<< a
9.99
<<< type(a)
<class 'float'>






: Python str() Function : 

- We saw how a Python obtains integer or float number from corresponding string representation. The str() function works the opposite. It surrounds an integer or a float object with quotes (') to return a str object. The str() function returns the string representation of any Python object. In this section, we shall see different examples of str() function in Python.

- The str() function has three parameters. First required parameter (or argument) is the object whose string representation we want. Other two operators, encoding and errors, are optional.

- We shall execute str() function in Python console to easily verify that the returned object is a string, with the enclosing quotation marks (').



<<< a = str(10)
<<< a
'10'
<<< type(a)
<class 'str'>








: Conversion of Sequence Types ( List , tuple , dictionary ) :

- List, Tuple and String are Python's sequence types. They are ordered or indexed collection of items.

- A string and tuple can be converted into a list object by using the list() function. Similarly, the tuple() function converts a string or list to a tuple.

- We shall take an object each of these three sequence types and study their inter-conversion :


<<< a=[1,2,3,4,5]   # List Object
<<< b=(1,2,3,4,5)   # Tupple Object
<<< c="Hello"       # String Object

### list() separates each character in the string and builds the list
<<< obj=list(c)
<<< obj
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

### The parentheses of tuple are replaced by square brackets
<<< obj=list(b)
<<< obj
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### tuple() separates each character from string and builds a tuple of characters
<<< obj=tuple(c)
<<< obj
('H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')

### square brackets of list are replaced by parentheses.
<<< obj=tuple(a)
<<< obj
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

### str() function puts the list and tuple inside the quote symbols.
<<< obj=str(a)
<<< obj
'[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]'

<<< obj=str(b)
<<< obj
'(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)'
