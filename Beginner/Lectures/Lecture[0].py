# :: First Python Program :

# 1. Print - Hello World!
# 2. Python As a Calculator
# 3. Running the Python code
# 4. Python Execution Steps
# 5. Interpreter v/s Compiler




# 1.  Print - Hello World! :-

 # - Printing "Hello World!" as the first program in Python.
 # - print is a keyword that has special meaning for Python.
 # - print means , "Display what's inside the parantheses."


# print("Hello World")

# Instructor = "Rishabh Mishra"
# print("Python by", Instructor, sep = "-")



# a = 5

# print(a)

# a = 10

# print(a)

# a = 15

# print(a)





# 2. Python As a Calculator :-

# - Python can be used as a powerfull Calculator for performing a wide range of arithmetic operations.

# 2 + 5

# print(10/5)   # Output : 2.0

# print sum of two numbers

# a = 2
# b = 5

# print(a+b)   # Output : 7  





# 3. Running the Python Code :-

# - Create a new text file and inside it write - print("Hello world!").
# - Save file with extension  .py - firstcopy.py.
# - Open command prompt on windows.
# - Enter the location where firstcopy.py file is saved - cd downloads.
# - Finally run the file as - python firstcopy.py.





# 4. Python Execution Flow : 

                          
#                             INTERPRETER



# Source Code  ----->       Check Syntax       ----->     Running Code
#                                |
#                                |
#                           Compile into
#                            Byte Code
#                                |
#                                |
#                             Virtual 
#                             Machine


# :: Python Code Execution Steps :

# 1. Lexical Analysis : 
# - The Interpreter breaks down the code into smaller parts called tokens. identifying words , numbers , symbols and punctuation.

# 2. Syntax Parsing : 
# - It Checks the structure of the code to ensure it follow the rules of python syntax. if there are any errors, like missing parantheses or incorrect indentation , it stops and shows a SyntaxError.

# 3. ByteCode Generation : 
# - Once the code is validated. the Interpreter translates it into a simpler set of Instructions called bytecode. This bytecode is easier for the computer to understand and execute.

# 4. Execution by PVM [ Python Virtual Machine ] :
# - The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) takes the bytecode and runs it step by step. It follows the Instructions and performs Calculations , assigns values to variables , and executes functions.

# 5. Error Handelling and Output : 
# - If there are any errors during execution , like trying to divide by zero or accessing a variable that does not exists  , the Interpreter raises an exception. If the code runs without errors , it didplays any output , such as printed message or returned values , to the user.









# 5. Interpreter V/s Compiler : 


# :: Interpreter : 

# -  an Interpreter translates and executes a source code line by line as the code runs.

# - Execution : Line by Line.

# - Speed : Slower execution because it translates each line on the fly.

# - Debugging  : Easier to debug as it stops at the first error encountered.

# - Examples : Python , Ruby , Javascript and PHP.




# :: Compiler : 

# -  A Compiler translates the entire code into machine code before the program runs.

# - Execution : Entire Program at once.

# - Speed : Faster execution because it translates the entire program at once.

# - Debugging  : Harder to debug because errors are reported after the entire code is compliled.

# - Examples : C , C++ , JAVA and GO.
