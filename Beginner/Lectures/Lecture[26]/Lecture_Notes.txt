# ::  File Handelling in Python :

# -  File Handelling in Python allows you to read from and write to files. This is important when you want to store data permanently or work with large data sets.

# - Python provides built - in functions and methods to intract with files.






# :-> Steps for file Handelling in Python : 

# - Opening a file.
# - Reading from a file.
# - Writing to a file.
# - Closing the file.







# 1. Open a File : 

# - To perform any operation (read / write) on a file , you first need to open the file using Python's open() function.

# :---> Syntax : file_object = open('filename', 'mode')

# :> 'Filename' : Name of the file(can be relative or absolute path). 
# :> 'mode' : Mode in which the file is opened(read , write, append , etc).



# :----> File Modes : 

# 1. 'r' : Read ( default mode ). Opens the file for reading.
# 2. 'w' : Write , Open the file for writing ( if file does not exists , it creates one).
# 3. 'a' : Append , Opens the file for appending ( if file does not exists , it creates one).
# 4. 'rb'/ 'wb' : Read/write in binary mode.


# :-----> Example : Opening a file for reading

# file = open('example.txt' , 'r')




























# 2. Read from a File :

# - Once a file is open , you can read from it using the following methods:

# read() : Reads the entire content of the file.
# readline() : Reads one line from the file at a time.
# readlines() : Reads all lines into a list.





# # :Example :-  Reading the entire file

# file = open('example.txt', 'r')
# content = file.read()
# print(content)
# file.close()


# # :Example :- Reading one line at a time

# file = open('example.txt' , 'r')
# line = file.readline()
# print(line)
# file.close()














# 3. Write to a File : 

# - To Write to a file , you can use the write() or writelines() method:

# :> write() : Writes a string to the file.
# :> writelines() : writes a list of strings.



# ----> Example : Writing to a file ( overwrites existing content ).

# file = open('example.txt' , 'w')
# file.write("Hello , world!")
# file.close()


# ------> Example : Appending to a file ( add line to the end ) .

# file = open('example.txt','a')
# file.write("\n This is an appended line.")
# file.close()


# ------> Close a file:

# file.close()
